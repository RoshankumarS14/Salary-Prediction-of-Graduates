# Student Salary Prediction Project 🎓💰

Welcome to the Student Salary Prediction project! This repository contains all the code and resources related to predicting student salaries based on various factors. We've done extensive data analysis and built predictive models to help you understand the outcomes.

## Project Overview 📚📊

In this project, the aim was to predict student salaries using various data analysis and machine learning techniques. Several important aspects of the project were covered:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis 📈🔍**
   
   Explore the dataset, visualize key statistics, and understand relationships between different variables. EDA includes count plots, histograms, box plots, heat maps, and pairwise scatter plots.

2. **Data Preprocessing 🧹📝**
   
   Prepare the data for modeling success by applying transformations using the Yeo-Johnson method, encoding categorical features using Target Encoding, and handling missing values.

3. **Model Building 🧱🤖**
   
   Construct predictive models using various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and ElasticNet. Ridge outperformed the other models.

4. **Model Selection 🏆📊**
   
   Choose the best model by comparing accuracy and performance metrics, with Ridge emerging as the top performer.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning ⚙️🔧**
   
   Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Ridge model using GridSearchCV to enhance its efficiency.

6. **Feature Selection 🧐🔍**
   
   Select essential features for model interpretability and performance using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Sequential Feature Selection (SFS).

7. **Feature Engineering 🛠️🔮**
   
   Experiment with feature engineering by generating polynomial features of degree 2. However, improved model performance was not observed.

8. **Results 📊📈**
   
   Present detailed results and insights from the final Ridge model, after hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, which achieved the best performance in predicting student salaries.

## Best Model 🏆

After evaluating all the models, the **Ridge** emerged as the top performer, demonstrating excellent generalization capabilities.
